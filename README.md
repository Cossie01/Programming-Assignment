Table of Contents

1. Introduction
The read me describes the overall basics of the numpy random package. 

The work is completed in a single jupyter notebook. In order to view the note book you will need to download it from the repository. It can seen as a static version using the software Jupyter Nbviewer.


2. 2.	The purpose of the Numpy Random Package.
-	Very fast application
-	Removes the use of For loops to speeds up the process.
-	Uses single type for each element in the array. It has to be a an int, float or boolean.
-	Uses less memory, for python lists it saves each element in memory using pointers. Numpy by passes this.
-	Saves coding time. Using lists you need to complete a for loop. Numpy takes care of the operation in the backround. 
-	Numpy Data Types (explain these)


3. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.


4. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions

5. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.
 - explain the difference between old and new algothrim PG64.
